# Crypto Fear and Greed API wrapper
`fng-api-wrapper` is a Rust API client for Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index.

The wrapper is incomplete and does not cover the entire API.  
So far it only covers the endpoint https://api.alternative.me/fng/

## Sample code
See [sample implementation](examples/sample_implementation.rs), or run it:

```bash
cargo run --example sample_implementation
```
